# Gemini Code Assistant

This file outlines the role of Gemini, a large language model from Google, in the development of the MIDI MCP Server project.

## Project Understanding

I have reviewed the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and understand the goal of the project is to build a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for music generation with MIDI.

The implementation will be done in phases, with a strong emphasis on testing and Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) validation.

## My Role

My primary purpose is to assist in the implementation of this project. I can help with:

*   **File creation and modification:** I can create new files and modify existing ones based on the project plan and your instructions.
*   **Code generation:** I can write Python code for the MCP server, tools, and tests.
*   **Running commands:** I can execute shell commands to run tests, manage dependencies, and interact with the file system.
*   **Documentation:** I can help create and maintain documentation.

I will follow the project's conventions and ask for clarification when needed. Let's get started!
