## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/midi-mcp.git
cd midi-mcp
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

1. **Configure MIDI Output**: Set up virtual MIDI routing (IAC Driver on Mac, loopMIDI on Windows)
2. **Connect Your DAW**: Route MIDI to your favorite music software
3. **Configure AI Agent**: Add server to GitHub Copilot or Claude Desktop

### Your First Composition
```python
# In your AI agent (GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, etc.):
"Create a blues progression in E major and play it"
"Now add a simple melody over those chords"
"Save this as a MIDI file called 'my_first_blues.mid'"
```
