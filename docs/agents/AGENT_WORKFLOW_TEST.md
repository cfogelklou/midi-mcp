# Agent Collaboration Workflow Test

## Test Overview
This document validates the agent collaboration framework by simulating a real implementation scenario. We'll test how the four specialized agents work together to solve a specific Phase 1 challenge.

## Test Scenario: "Implement MIDI Device Discovery with Cross-Platform Support"

### Scenario Description
**Challenge**: Create a robust MIDI device discovery system that works across macOS, Windows, and Linux, with proper error handling and user-friendly feedback.

**Complexity**: This requires architectural design, MIDI expertise, comprehensive testing, and clear documentation - perfect for testing agent collaboration.

## Agent Collaboration Simulation

### Initial Problem Statement
**From Project Lead (You)**: 
"We need to implement MIDI device discovery that works reliably across all platforms, handles edge cases gracefully, and provides clear feedback to users. This needs to be ready for HIL testing with AI agents."

---

### Architecture Agent Response
**Agent Activation**: Architecture Agent takes lead on system design

**Analysis**: 
- This requires a plugin architecture to handle different MIDI backends
- Need clean abstractions to hide platform differences from users
- Must be designed for testability and error handling
- Should integrate smoothly with MCP tool registration

**Proposed Solution**:
```python
# Abstract interface for cross-platform compatibility
class MIDIBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def enumerate_devices(self) -> List[MIDIDevice]: ...
    
    @abstractmethod  
    async def get_device_capabilities(self, device_id: str) -> DeviceCapabilities: ...

# Factory for backend selection
class MIDIBackendFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_backend(platform: str = None) -> MIDIBackend:
        platform = platform or detect_platform()
        return BACKEND_MAP[platform]()

# Main service with clean error handling
class MIDIDeviceService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.backend = MIDIBackendFactory.create_backend()
        self.device_cache = DeviceCache()
    
    async def discover_devices(self) -> DeviceDiscoveryResult:
        try:
            devices = await self.backend.enumerate_devices()
            return DeviceDiscoveryResult(success=True, devices=devices)
        except MIDIError as e:
            return DeviceDiscoveryResult(success=False, error=e)
```

**Architecture Recommendations**:
1. Use dependency injection for testability
2. Implement caching to avoid repeated device scans
3. Create clear error hierarchies for different failure types
4. Design for async operation to avoid blocking MCP server

**Request to MIDI Expert**: "I need platform-specific implementation details and error condition identification"

**Request to Testing Orchestrator**: "This architecture needs validation for testability and edge case coverage"

**Request to Documentation Agent**: "The API needs to be intuitive for AI agents to use correctly"

---

### MIDI Expert Agent Response
**Agent Activation**: MIDI Expert Agent provides domain expertise

**Technical Analysis**:
- macOS: CoreMIDI framework via mido or python-rtmidi
- Windows: Windows Multimedia API (WinMM) integration
- Linux: ALSA MIDI subsystem

**Platform-Specific Implementation**:
```python
class CoreMIDIBackend(MIDIBackend):
    """macOS CoreMIDI implementation"""
    async def enumerate_devices(self) -> List[MIDIDevice]:
        # Use mido.get_output_names() with CoreMIDI backend
        # Handle IAC Driver detection
        # Filter out system-only devices
        
class WinMMBackend(MIDIBackend):
    """Windows Multimedia API implementation"""
    async def enumerate_devices(self) -> List[MIDIDevice]:
        # Use python-rtmidi with WinMM backend
        # Handle DirectSound vs. WinMM differences  
        # Detect virtual MIDI ports
        
class ALSABackend(MIDIBackend):
    """Linux ALSA implementation"""  
    async def enumerate_devices(self) -> List[MIDIDevice]:
        # Use python-rtmidi with ALSA backend
        # Handle ALSA sequencer vs. raw MIDI
        # Detect software synthesizers
```

**Critical Technical Details**:
- Device enumeration can be slow (100-500ms) - needs async handling
- Device IDs may change between scans - implement stable identification
- Some backends require initialization before enumeration works
- Virtual MIDI ports need special handling on each platform

**Error Conditions to Handle**:
- No MIDI subsystem available (rare but possible)
- Permissions issues (Linux, some Windows configurations)
- Driver initialization failures
- Device hardware disconnection during enumeration

**Performance Considerations**:
- Cache device list for 30-60 seconds to avoid repeated slow scans
- Use background refresh with event notifications when possible
- Implement timeout for device enumeration (5 second max)

**Request to Architecture Agent**: "Need async caching strategy and error handling integration"

**Request to Testing Orchestrator**: "These are the error conditions and edge cases that must be tested"

---

### Testing Orchestrator Agent Response
**Agent Activation**: Testing Orchestrator Agent focuses on validation strategy

**Test Strategy Analysis**:
This functionality needs comprehensive testing across multiple dimensions:
1. Functional correctness across platforms
2. Error handling and edge cases
3. Performance under various conditions
4. HIL validation with real users

**Automated Test Plan**:
```python
class MIDIDeviceDiscoveryTestSuite:
    """Comprehensive test suite for device discovery"""
    
    async def test_basic_device_discovery(self):
        """Test basic device enumeration works"""
        service = MIDIDeviceService()
        result = await service.discover_devices()
        assert result.success
        assert len(result.devices) >= 0  # May be zero on systems without MIDI
    
    async def test_platform_specific_backends(self):
        """Test each platform backend individually"""
        for platform in ['darwin', 'win32', 'linux']:
            backend = MIDIBackendFactory.create_backend(platform)
            devices = await backend.enumerate_devices()
            # Platform-specific validations
    
    async def test_error_conditions(self):
        """Test all identified error conditions"""
        # Mock various error conditions
        # Verify appropriate error responses
        # Ensure system remains stable after errors
    
    async def test_performance_requirements(self):
        """Test performance meets requirements"""
        start_time = time.time()
        result = await service.discover_devices()
        elapsed = time.time() - start_time
        assert elapsed < 5.0  # Must complete within 5 seconds
```

**HIL Test Scenarios**:
```yaml
hil_test_device_discovery:
  scenario: "Basic device discovery validation"
  setup: 
    - Start MCP server
    - Connect AI agent
    - Ensure at least one MIDI device available
  procedure:
    1. Ask AI: "List available MIDI devices"
    2. Verify AI receives device list
    3. Ask AI: "How many MIDI devices are available?"
  expected_outcome:
    - AI correctly reports number of devices
    - Device names are human-readable
    - No errors or timeouts occur
  success_criteria:
    - Response time < 5 seconds
    - Device information is accurate
    - AI can interpret results correctly

hil_test_no_devices:
  scenario: "Handling systems with no MIDI devices"
  setup:
    - System with no MIDI devices or virtual ports
  procedure:
    1. Ask AI: "List available MIDI devices"
    2. Ask AI: "Why are no MIDI devices available?"
  expected_outcome:
    - AI reports no devices available
    - Helpful explanation provided
    - System remains functional
  success_criteria:
    - Clear, helpful error message
    - AI understands the situation
    - No system crashes or hangs
```

**Edge Case Testing**:
1. **Device Removal During Discovery**: Unplug USB MIDI device while scanning
2. **Permission Denial**: Test on Linux system without MIDI permissions
3. **Driver Issues**: Test with corrupted or missing MIDI drivers
4. **Performance Under Load**: Test with many virtual MIDI ports
5. **Rapid Successive Calls**: Test system stability with rapid discovery requests

**Quality Metrics**:
- **Functional Success Rate**: >98% successful device discovery
- **Error Handling**: 100% of error conditions handled gracefully
- **Performance**: <5 second discovery time, <1 second for cached results
- **HIL Satisfaction**: >90% user satisfaction with device discovery experience

**Request to Architecture Agent**: "Need mock interfaces for testing error conditions"

**Request to Documentation Agent**: "User error messages need to be validated for clarity"

---

### Documentation Agent Response  
**Agent Activation**: Documentation Agent ensures user experience excellence

**User Experience Analysis**:
Device discovery is often the first interaction users have with the system. It must be intuitive and provide clear feedback.

**API Documentation Draft**:
```markdown
## list_midi_devices

Discover all available MIDI output devices on the system.

### Usage
Ask your AI agent: `"List available MIDI devices"`

### Returns
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "0", 
      "name": "IAC Driver Bus 1",
      "type": "virtual",
      "platform": "macos"
    },
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "USB MIDI Keyboard", 
      "type": "hardware",
      "platform": "macos"
    }
  ],
  "scan_time": 0.234
}
```

### Common Issues

**No devices found**
- **Problem**: `{"success": true, "devices": []}`
- **Solution**: Check MIDI setup, enable virtual MIDI ports
- **macOS**: Enable IAC Driver in Audio MIDI Setup
- **Windows**: Install loopMIDI or similar virtual MIDI software
- **Linux**: Ensure ALSA MIDI is configured

**Permission errors**
- **Problem**: `{"success": false, "error": "Permission denied"}`  
- **Solution**: Check MIDI permissions
- **Linux**: Add user to `audio` group: `sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER`

**Slow response**
- **Problem**: Device discovery takes >5 seconds
- **Solution**: Check for problematic MIDI devices, restart MIDI services
```

**User Journey Documentation**:
```markdown
# Setting Up MIDI Devices

## Step 1: Verify Device Discovery
First, check that your system can discover MIDI devices:

Ask your AI agent: `"List available MIDI devices"`

You should see output like:
```
I found 2 MIDI devices:
1. IAC Driver Bus 1 (virtual)
2. USB MIDI Keyboard (hardware)
```

If you see "No MIDI devices found", continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Enable Virtual MIDI (if no devices found)
...
```

**Error Message Validation**:
All error messages must be:
1. **Clear**: Non-technical language explaining what went wrong
2. **Actionable**: Specific steps to resolve the issue  
3. **Context-Aware**: Different messages for different platforms
4. **Helpful**: Links to detailed troubleshooting when appropriate

**Request to Testing Orchestrator**: "These error messages need HIL validation for clarity"

**Request to Architecture Agent**: "Error responses should include suggested actions"
