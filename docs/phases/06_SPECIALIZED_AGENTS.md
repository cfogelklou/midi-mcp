## Agent Personalities and Specializations

### Composer Agent Profile
```yaml
personality:
  creative_focus: "High-level artistic vision and song structure"
  strengths: ["song structure", "thematic development", "creative inspiration"]
  communication_style: "Artistic and conceptual, focuses on emotional impact"
  typical_workflows: ["inspiration_to_song", "concept_development", "creative_iteration"]

knowledge_priorities:
  - Song form and structure across genres
  - Lyrical and melodic theme development
  - Creative constraints and inspiration techniques
  - Commercial and artistic balance considerations

tool_preferences:
  primary: ["compose_complete_song", "develop_song_concept", "create_song_structure"]
  secondary: ["genre-specific composition tools", "melodic development tools"]
  rarely_uses: ["detailed voice leading", "technical audio processing"]
```

### Arranger Agent Profile
```yaml
personality:
  creative_focus: "Orchestration, instrumentation, and ensemble writing"
  strengths: ["voice leading", "instrumental idioms", "ensemble balance"]
  communication_style: "Technical but musical, focused on practical implementation"
  typical_workflows: ["melody_to_arrangement", "ensemble_optimization", "part_creation"]

knowledge_priorities:
  - Instrument ranges, capabilities, and limitations
  - Idiomatic writing for all instruments
  - Ensemble balance and texture management
  - Historical and contemporary arrangement styles

tool_preferences:
  primary: ["arrange_for_ensemble", "optimize_voice_leading", "create_counter_melodies"]
  secondary: ["advanced harmony tools", "texture management tools"]
  rarely_uses: ["high-level composition", "audio engineering"]
```

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### Agent Collaboration Workflows
1. **Sequential Workflow**: Composer → Arranger → Audio Engineer
2. **Iterative Workflow**: Theory Assistant analyzes → Composer refines → repeat
3. **Parallel Workflow**: Multiple agents work on different aspects simultaneously
4. **Consultative Workflow**: Primary agent consults specialists for specific tasks

### Context Sharing Protocol
- **Project Context**: Current composition, key, tempo, genre, target audience
- **Musical Context**: Active chord progressions, melodies, arrangements
- **Technical Context**: MIDI configuration, active instruments, mix settings
- **Creative Context**: Artistic goals, constraints, inspiration sources

## HIL Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Agent Specialization
```
Human: "I want to create a jazz ballad. Activate the composer agent."
Expected: AI switches to composer persona, focuses on song structure and emotional content
Result: Composer creates complete song structure with jazz ballad characteristics
```

### Scenario 2: Agent Handoff
```
Human: "Now have the arranger take this melody and create a small jazz ensemble arrangement."
Expected: AI switches to arranger agent, receives composition context, creates arrangement
Result: Professional jazz arrangement with proper voice leading and instrumental parts
```

### Scenario 3: Agent Consultation
```
Human: "Ask the theory assistant to analyze the harmony in this arrangement and suggest improvements."
Expected: Theory agent analyzes and provides educational insights and suggestions
Result: Detailed harmonic analysis with pedagogical explanations and improvement suggestions
```

### Scenario 4: Multi-Agent Collaboration
```
Human: "I want to create a complete song production using all agents."
Expected: Agents collaborate in sequence with proper context transfer
Result: Complete song from concept through final mix with each agent contributing expertise
```

### Scenario 5: Agent Recommendation
```
Human: "I have a melody and want to make it more interesting. Which agent should I use?"
Expected: System recommends arranger for orchestration or composer for development
Result: Appropriate agent recommendation with reasoning
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All five agent types demonstrate distinct personalities and capabilities
- [ ] Agent switching preserves context and maintains workflow continuity
- [ ] Specialized tools are appropriately filtered and accessible per agent
- [ ] Multi-agent collaboration produces superior results to single-agent work
- [ ] Agent recommendations are accurate and helpful
- [ ] Each agent provides value that others cannot
- [ ] Agent interactions feel natural and productive
- [ ] All HIL test scenarios demonstrate clear agent specialization

## Agent Performance Metrics
- **Specialization Accuracy**: Agent uses appropriate tools for its domain
- **Context Retention**: Information preserved during agent switches
- **Collaboration Effectiveness**: Multi-agent workflows produce better results
- **User Experience**: Natural interaction with agent personalities
- **Task Completion**: Agents successfully complete domain-specific tasks

## Integration Notes
- All agents have access to core MIDI and theory functionality
- Agent specializations are additive, not restrictive
- Previous phase functionality remains available to all agents
- Agent system can be bypassed for direct tool access when needed

## Next Phase Preparation
- Test agent specializations with complex musical projects
- Validate that each agent provides unique value
- Prepare production-level features for Phase 7
- Ensure agent system scales well with additional complexity

Phase 6 creates a sophisticated agent ecosystem that provides specialized expertise while maintaining the flexibility to handle any musical task through appropriate agent selection and collaboration.
