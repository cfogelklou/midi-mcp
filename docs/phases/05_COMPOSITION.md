- **Phrase Structure**: Clear antecedent and consequent phrases
- **Climax Points**: Well-placed melodic high points
- **Cadences**: Appropriate phrase endings
- **Memorability**: Melodic hooks and memorable passages

- **Harmonic Rhythm**: Appropriate rate of harmonic change
- **Functional Progression**: Clear tonal movement and resolution
- **Variety**: Balance of consonance and dissonance
- **Genre Appropriateness**: Harmony matches style expectations

## HIL Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Song Creation
```
Human: "Create a complete pop ballad about lost love in the key of F major"
Expected: AI generates full song structure (verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus-outro)
         with appropriate melody, harmony, and arrangement
Result: Complete, emotionally appropriate ballad that tells a musical story
```

### Scenario 2: Classical Development
```
Human: "Take this simple melody and develop it using classical techniques"
Expected: AI applies sequence, inversion, fragmentation, and other development methods
Result: Sophisticated melodic development that maintains coherence while adding complexity
```

### Scenario 3: Jazz Arrangement
```
Human: "Arrange this melody for jazz quartet with walking bass and comping piano"
Expected: AI creates appropriate parts for each instrument with jazz idioms
Result: Professional-level jazz arrangement with proper voice leading and style
```

### Scenario 4: Genre Fusion Composition
```
Human: "Compose a piece that blends classical structure with rock energy"
Expected: AI combines classical forms with rock instrumentation and energy
Result: Creative fusion that respects both traditions while creating something new
```

### Scenario 5: Composition Analysis and Improvement
```
Human: "Analyze this composition and suggest three specific improvements"
Expected: AI identifies weaknesses in melody, harmony, or structure and suggests fixes
Result: Constructive analysis with actionable suggestions for improvement
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] AI agents can create complete, multi-section compositions
- [ ] Melodic development techniques produce sophisticated results
- [ ] Voice leading optimization creates smooth harmonic progressions
- [ ] Arrangements are idiomatic and balanced for target ensembles
- [ ] Complete compositions have proper form and structure
- [ ] All composition tools integrate seamlessly with previous phases
- [ ] Musical output meets professional quality standards
- [ ] All HIL test scenarios demonstrate advanced composition capabilities

## Integration Notes
- All composition tools work with genre knowledge from Phase 4
- Compositions can be saved and edited using Phase 2 MIDI tools
- Real-time playback (Phase 1) works with generated compositions
- Music theory validation (Phase 3) ensures harmonic correctness

## Performance Considerations
- Composition generation may take 30-60 seconds for complete songs
- Memory usage scales with composition complexity
- Large arrangements may require streaming playback
- Caching of common patterns improves response time

## Next Phase Preparation
- Test composition quality with musicians and composers
- Verify that AI agents can create satisfying complete works
- Prepare specialized agent implementations for Phase 6
- Review professional production requirements

Phase 5 transforms the system into a full composition environment capable of creating complete, professionally structured musical works. This phase bridges the gap between simple pattern generation and sophisticated musical composition.
