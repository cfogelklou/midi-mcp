# Code Review and Analysis

This document provides a review of the `midi-mcp` server codebase, highlighting potential areas for improvement and outlining a strategy for end-to-end testing.

## 1. Anti-patterns

Anti-patterns are common solutions to problems that are generally considered to be ineffective or counterproductive.

*   **Platform-Specific Code:** The `src/midi_mcp/midi/manager.py` file contains platform-specific code for listing MIDI devices. This can make the code harder to maintain and port to other operating systems. It would be better to abstract this logic into separate modules for each platform or use a cross-platform library if one is available.
*   **Blocking Human-in-the-Loop (HIL):** The `HumanInTheLoop` class in `src/midi_mcp/genres/composition_engine.py` appears to rely on user input from the console. In a server application, this is a significant anti-pattern as it will block the server's event loop, making it unresponsive to other requests. This should be re-implemented using a non-blocking mechanism, such as a websocket, a separate API endpoint for HIL feedback, or a message queue.

## 2. Technical Debt

Technical debt is code that was written for a short-term fix that will need to be refactored later.

*   **Large, Complex Modules:** The `src/midi_mcp/genres/composition_engine.py` file is quite large and complex. This makes it difficult to understand, maintain, and test. It should be broken down into smaller, more manageable modules with clear responsibilities.
*   **Complex `music21` Usage:** The project makes extensive use of the `music21` library. While powerful, `music21` has a steep learning curve. The code that interacts with this library could be a source of technical debt if it is not well-documented and abstracted. Consider creating a dedicated module to encapsulate the `music21` logic and provide a simpler interface to the rest of the application.

## 3. Unused Code

At this stage, a definitive analysis of unused code is challenging without a deeper understanding of the project's evolution. However, a static analysis tool like `vulture` could be used to identify potentially dead code.

To run `vulture`, you would first need to install it:

```bash
pip install vulture
```

Then, you could run it on the `src` directory:

```bash
vulture src/
```

This would produce a report of potentially unused code.

## 4. Potential Simplifications

*   **Tool Registration:** The `tools` directory contains several files for different tool categories. This could be simplified by using a more dynamic approach to tool discovery and registration. For example, you could use a decorator to mark functions as tools and then have a single module that automatically discovers and registers all decorated functions.
*   **Configuration:** The configuration is currently handled by a `settings.py` file. This could be simplified by using a standard configuration format like YAML or TOML, and a library like `pydantic` for validation. This would make the configuration more explicit and easier to manage.

## 5. End-to-End Testing Strategy

End-to-end (E2E) tests are crucial for ensuring that the server works as expected from the perspective of an AI agent. Here is a proposed strategy for creating automatic E2E tests:

### 5.1. Test Framework

A popular and powerful test framework for Python is `pytest`. It can be used in conjunction with a library like `httpx` to send requests to the server.

### 5.2. Test Structure

The E2E tests should be placed in a separate directory, for example, `tests/e2e`. Each test file should cover a specific feature of the server.

### 5.3. Test Implementation

Each E2E test should follow these steps:

1.  **Start the server:** The test should start the `midi-mcp` server as a subprocess.
2.  **Send requests:** The test should use an HTTP client like `httpx` to send JSON-RPC requests to the server's endpoints. The requests should be designed to simulate the interactions of an AI agent.
3.  **Assert responses:** The test should assert that the server's responses are correct. This includes checking the status code, the content of the response, and any side effects (e.g., created files).
4.  **Validate response schema:** Use a library like `jsonschema` to validate the structure of the server's JSON-RPC responses. This will ensure that the server's API remains consistent.
5.  **Stop the server:** The test should stop the server subprocess after the test is complete.

### 5.4. Example Test Case

Here is an example of what an E2E test case for the `create_midi_file` tool might look like:

```python
import httpx
import subprocess
import time
import os
from jsonschema import validate

def test_create_midi_file():
    # 1. Start the server
    server_process = subprocess.Popen(["python", "-m", "src.midi_mcp.core.server"])
    time.sleep(2)  # Give the server time to start

    # 2. Send request
    with httpx.Client() as client:
        response = client.post(
            "http://localhost:8000/mcp",
            json={
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "method": "create_midi_file",
                "params": {
                    "file_path": "test.mid",
                    "notes": ["C4", "E4", "G4"],
                },
                "id": 1,
            },
        )

    # 3. Assert response
    assert response.status_code == 200
    response_data = response.json()
    assert response_data["result"]["success"] is True

    # 4. Validate response schema
    schema = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "success": {"type": "boolean"},
            "file_path": {"type": "string"},
        },
        "required": ["success", "file_path"],
    }
    validate(instance=response_data["result"], schema=schema)

    # 5. Check side effects
    assert os.path.exists("test.mid")
    os.remove("test.mid")

    # 6. Stop the server
    server_process.terminate()
```

By following this strategy, you can create a comprehensive suite of E2E tests that will ensure the quality and reliability of the `midi-mcp` server.
