# LibraryIntegration Singleton Implementation

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the repeated library initialization warnings and ToolRegistry errors when starting the midi-mcp server.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Multiple Library Initialization Messages**: The `LibraryIntegration` class was being instantiated multiple times across different modules, causing repeated initialization logging.

2. **ToolRegistry Method Error**: Composition tools were calling `register_tool()` method which doesn't exist on the `ToolRegistry` class.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Singleton Pattern for LibraryIntegration

**File**: `src/midi_mcp/genres/library_integration.py`

- Added thread-safe singleton pattern to `LibraryIntegration` class
- Used double-checked locking pattern with `threading.Lock()` 
- Added `_initialized` class variable to ensure initialization happens only once
- Added convenience function `get_library_integration()` for easier access

**Key Changes**:
```python
class LibraryIntegration:
    _instance = None
    _lock = threading.Lock()
    _initialized = False
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            with cls._lock:
                if cls._instance is None:
                    cls._instance = super(LibraryIntegration, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
    
    def __init__(self):
        if self._initialized:
            return
        with self._lock:
            if self._initialized:
                return
            # ... initialization code ...
            LibraryIntegration._initialized = True
```

### 2. Fixed Tool Registration

**File**: `src/midi_mcp/tools/composition_tools.py`

- Removed incorrect `tool_registry.register_tool()` calls at the end of the file
- The composition tools already use the correct `@app.tool()` decorator pattern
- This matches the pattern used by other tool modules

**Removed**:
```python
# These lines were removed (they were incorrect):
tool_registry.register_tool("create_song_structure", "...")
tool_registry.register_tool("generate_song_section", "...")
# ... etc
```

### 3. Updated Logging Levels

- Changed individual integration logging from `INFO` to `DEBUG` level
- Only the main `LibraryIntegration` logs at `INFO` level now
- This reduces noise while maintaining useful information

## Results

### Before:
```
2025-09-01 07:45:07,139 - midi_mcp.genres.library_integration - INFO - pretty_midi integration initialized
2025-09-01 07:45:07,899 - midi_mcp.genres.library_integration - INFO - muspy integration initialized
2025-09-01 07:45:07,899 - midi_mcp.genres.library_integration - INFO - Library integration initialized. Available: music21, pretty_midi, muspy
2025-09-01 07:45:07,900 - midi_mcp.genres.library_integration - INFO - music21 integration initialized
2025-09-01 07:45:07,900 - midi_mcp.genres.library_integration - INFO - pretty_midi integration initialized
... (many more repeated messages)
2025-09-01 07:45:07,938 - midi_mcp - ERROR - Error registering composition tools: 'ToolRegistry' object has no attribute 'register_tool'
```

### After:
```
2025-09-01 07:50:12,370 - midi_mcp - INFO - Logging initialized at INFO level
2025-09-01 07:50:12,372 - midi_mcp.midi.manager - INFO - MIDI Manager initialized
2025-09-01 07:50:12,372 - midi_mcp - INFO - MIDI MCP Server initialized with Phase 1-5 capabilities
2025-09-01 07:50:12,380 - midi_mcp.tools.midi_tools - INFO - Registered 6 MIDI tools
2025-09-01 07:50:12,390 - midi_mcp.tools.file_tools - INFO - Registered 8 MIDI file tools
Registered 15 music theory tools
2025-09-01 07:50:13,345 - midi_mcp.genres.library_integration - INFO - Library integration initialized. Available: music21, pretty_midi, muspy
2025-09-01 07:50:13,355 - midi_mcp.tools.genre_tools - INFO - Genre MCP tools registered successfully
```

## Testing

Created `test_singleton.py` to verify:
- ✅ Singleton pattern works correctly 
- ✅ All instances return the same object
- ✅ Thread safety is maintained
- ✅ Functionality is preserved

## Benefits

1. **Clean Server Startup**: No more repeated initialization messages
2. **Reduced Memory Usage**: Only one LibraryIntegration instance across the entire application
3. **Better Performance**: Library integrations are initialized once and reused
4. **Thread Safety**: Multiple threads can safely access the singleton
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding a reset method for testing purposes
- Monitor memory usage to ensure no memory leaks
- Consider lazy loading of individual integrations if startup time becomes an issue
